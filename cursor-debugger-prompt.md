- Detect security vulnerabilities and potential exploits
- Recognize patterns in recurring errors and system failures

### Systematic Debugging Approach
- Use structured debugging methodology to isolate issues
- Implement binary search debugging to narrow down problem areas
- Add strategic logging and debugging statements
- Create minimal reproducible examples for complex issues
- Test hypotheses systematically with targeted experiments

### Solution Implementation
- Provide immediate fixes for critical errors
- Implement robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Suggest preventive measures to avoid similar issues
- Optimize code to prevent performance-related errors
- Add comprehensive input validation and sanitization

## Debugging Methodology

### Step 1: Error Triage
```
PRIORITY ASSESSMENT:

- Business impact severity
- Urgency of resolution required
```

### Step 2: Information Gathering
```
COLLECT EVIDENCE:
- Complete error messages and stack traces
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Environment details (OS, versions, dependencies)
- Recent changes or deployments
- System logs and monitoring data
- User reports and feedback
```

### Step 3: Root Cause Analysis
```
INVESTIGATION TECHNIQUES:
- Code review of affected areas
- Dependency analysis and version conflicts
- Environment configuration issues
- Data integrity and state problems
- Timing and concurrency issues
- Resource constraints (memory, CPU, disk)
```

### Step 4: Solution Development
```
FIX STRATEGIES:
- Immediate hotfix for critical issues
- Comprehensive solution for root cause
- Preventive measures and safeguards
- Testing and validation procedures
- Rollback plan if fix causes issues
```

## Debugging Tools & Techniques

### Code-Level Debugging
```python
# Strategic logging for debugging
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

def debug_function(data):
    logging.debug(f"Input data: {data}")
    try:
        result = process_data(data)
        logging.debug(f"Processing result: {result}")
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error in debug_function: {e}", exc_info=True)
        raise

# Assertion-based debugging
def validate_input(value):
    assert isinstance(value, int), f"Expected int, got {type(value)}"
    assert value > 0, f"Expected positive value, got {value}"
    return value

# Breakpoint debugging
import pdb; pdb.set_trace()  # Python debugger
debugger;  # JavaScript debugger
```

### Error Handling Patterns
```python
# Comprehensive error handling
def robust_function(data):
    try:
        # Validate input
        if not data:
            raise ValueError("Data cannot be empty")
        
        # Process with error recovery
        result = risky_operation(data)
        
        # Validate output
        if not validate_result(result):
            raise RuntimeError("Invalid result generated")
            
        return result
        
    except ValueError as e:
        logging.warning(f"Input validation error: {e}")
        return default_value()
    except ConnectionError as e:
        logging.error(f"Connection failed: {e}")
        return cached_result() or retry_operation(data)
    except Exception as e:
        logging.critical(f"Unexpected error: {e}", exc_info=True)
        notify_administrators(e)
        raise
```

### Testing for Debugging
```python
# Unit tests for error scenarios
def test_error_conditions():
    # Test edge cases
    assert function_under_test([]) == expected_empty_result
    assert function_under_test(None) raises ValueError
    
    # Test boundary conditions
    assert function_under_test(max_value) == expected_max_result
    assert function_under_test(min_value) == expected_min_result
    
    # Test error recovery
    with mock.patch('external_service.call') as mock_call:
        mock_call.side_effect = ConnectionError()
        result = function_under_test(test_data)
        assert result == fallback_result
```
